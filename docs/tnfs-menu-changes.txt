This update contains firware changes to 
support TNFS menus which extends gopher-
-like functionality to the FujiNet disk
images browser. Like Gopher menus, TNFS
menus are line based, with each line
defining the type, name and location
of a menu resource.

This change requires a corresponding
update to the Config application to be
activated, but is backwards compatible
with existing Config apps.

Menu Format: [-<type> ]<item>

 <type> : Optional. Integer value 
          indicating the menu item 
          type. If the type field is 
          not present, the type is 
          assumed to be 0.
 <item> : String describing the item to
          be accessed by the menu 
          browser. Format of this item
          is determined by type.

Item types supported in this update:

 0000 : Line of plain text to be
        displayed by the TNFS browser. 
 0001 : Local file folder. <item> is the
        name of the folder.
 0002 : Binary image in the current
        directory. <item> is set to the
        image filename.
 0003 : TNFS host link. <item> is the
        TNFS hostname. 
 7F7F : End of menu. Optional.

 The type field can be omitted, the 
 default type is 0000. 

 While it is possible for individual 
 clients to overload types and define
 client-specific behavior, the 
 fujiMenu.h firmware source file is 
 considered the official source for
 supported types.
